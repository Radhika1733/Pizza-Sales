 # OVEN STORY PIZZA SALES DATA ANALYSIS:

# Objective - 
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive data analysis for the Oven Story Pizza Company using various SQL queries. The objective is to draw meaningful insights from the data to drive sales growth, boost revenue profitability, and learn about client preferences.

# Description - 
1. The analysis provided valuable insights into the amount of orders placed, revenue earned, top-selling pizzas, most often ordered pizzas, number of pizzas purchased per hour, and day and more.
2. The findings of this analysis reveal practical insights that can support the formulation of strategic choices, promote improvements in efficiency, and eventually contribute to the company's success by enhancing its sales.
3. Using SQL, I was able to aggregate data from multiple tables by combinig them to derive insights using the JOIN and GROUP BY functions, as well as sorting the data using the ORDER BY function.
4. Furthermore, using functions such as COUNT and SUM helped me summarise the data.
